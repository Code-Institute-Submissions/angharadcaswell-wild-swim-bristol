            <h2> 1. Clevedon Marine Lake</h2>
            <br>
               <p>Clevedon Marine Lake is a tidal infinity pool filled with sea water. It is a very popular spot with beautiful views of the pier and the Bristol Channel.</p>
                <p>It is regularly drained and monitored to maintain excellent water quality.</p>
                <p>pool is the perfect way to start your wild swimming journey as it has easy access to the water and shallower sections. You will see a range of swimming abilities at the Clevedon.

                <br>
                <p>Best way to enjoy the pool... avoid the crowds by visiting in the evening for a stunning sunset swim followed by some tasty fish & chips. </p>

                        <p>Walking to Clevedon from Bristol is also a great option for those who like to take a more adventerous journey. Hike via Cadbury Camp fort and reward yourself for those miles with a dip in the lake at the end. To get back either reverse the route or take a public bus back into Bristol town.

            <h2> 2. Warleigh Weir</h2>
            <br>
                <p>Warleigh Weir is located closer to Bath than Bristol but is a very popular spot for any wild swimmer. The disadvantages of this spot is it can get very busy in the summer and there is no official parking. We think the latter is a great opportunity to use alternative transport options if they are available to you. See below for our recommendations. </p>
               
                <p>Once you have arrived at the Weir there is easy access into the water (small steps) and a large area of grass to bask in the sun after your swim. </p>
                 <p>It is private land and needs to be respected. You can’t have BBQs and there are no amenities. Make sure you have everything you need for a fun day of picnics and swimming.  </p>
                 <p>Warleigh Weir is campaining to be an official Designated Swimming Spot. This means that the water quality would be regularly checked. You can help make this happen, take a look at the information provided <a href="https://warleighweir.co.uk/designated-bathing-water/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

                        <p>Take the train from Bristol to Bath Spa. Direct trains can take as little as 12 minutes to get to Bath. 
                            From there you have the option to a 4 mile walk or cycle to the weir <a href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/403783888?ref=wtd" target="_blank"> Route here</a>. If you choose to cycle, don’t forget to book your bike onto the train. 
                            Or you can take the bus (14 mins) to Claverton Village (D1 service towards North Bradley).

            <h2> 3. Saltford</h2>
            <br>
                <p>Saltford swim spot is located just off the Bristol/ Bath bike path. 

                    There are access points along both sides of the river. Be careful as it gets deep quickly and boats use the stretch of water. A tow float is definitely recommended so you are visible in the water. 
                </p>
                <br>
                    <p>
                    There are no shops near the spot so make sure you have everything you need for a fun day out. 
                    
                    The Jolly Sailor pub has a garden next to the weir for your post-swim pint. </p>
