                <br>
                <p>Best way to enjoy the pool... avoid the crowds by visiting in the evening for a stunning sunset swim followed by some tasty fish & chips. </p>

            <h2> 2. Warleigh Weir</h2>
            <br>
                <p>Warleigh Weir is located closer to Bath than Bristol but is a very popular spot for any wild swimmer. The disadvantages of this spot is it can get very busy in the summer and there is no official parking. We think the latter is a great opportunity to use alternative transport options if they are available to you. See below for our recommendations. </p>
               
                <p>Once you have arrived at the Weir there is easy access into the water (small steps) and a large area of grass to bask in the sun after your swim. </p>
                 <p>It is private land and needs to be respected. You canâ€™t have BBQs and there are no amenities. Make sure you have everything you need for a fun day of picnics and swimming.  </p>
                 <p>Warleigh Weir is campaining to be an official Designated Swimming Spot. This means that the water quality would be regularly checked. You can help make this happen, take a look at the information provided <a href="https://warleighweir.co.uk/designated-bathing-water/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
