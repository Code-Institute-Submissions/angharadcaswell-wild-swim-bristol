                <p>Clevedon Marine Lake is a tidal infinity pool filled with sea water. It is a very popular spot with beautiful views of the pier and the Bristol Channel.</p>
                <p>It is regularly drained and monitored to maintain excellent water quality.</p>
                <p>pool is the perfect way to start your wild swimming journey as it has easy access to the water and shallower sections. You will see a range of swimming abilities at the Clevedon. From people swimming lengths to those who just want to float around and take in the views. There is also a shallow and contained section for children to swim in.</p>  
                <br>
                <p>Best way to enjoy the pool... avoid the crowds by visiting in the evening for a stunning sunset swim followed by some tasty fish & chips. </p>
