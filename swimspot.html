            <h2> 1. Clevedon Marine Lake</h2>
            <br>
               <p>Clevedon Marine Lake is a tidal infinity pool filled with sea water. It is a very popular spot with beautiful views of the pier and the Bristol Channel.</p>
                <p>It is regularly drained and monitored to maintain excellent water quality.</p>
                <p>The pool is the perfect way to start your wild swimming journey as it has easy access to the water and shallower sections. You will see a range of swimming abilities at the Clevedon. From people swimming lengths to those who just want to float around and take in the views. There is also a shallow and contained section for children to swim in.</p>  
             
                <p>Best way to enjoy the pool... avoid the crowds by visiting in the evening for a stunning sunset swim followed by some tasty fish & chips. </p>

                    <p>You can cycle to Clevedon from Bristol. It requires a good level of fitness and confidence to ride on the roads. Check out this <a href="https://www.komoot.com/smarttour/5114058?ref=wsd" target="_blank">route on Komoot.</a></p>

                        <p>Walking to Clevedon from Bristol is also a great option for those who like to take a more adventerous journey. Hike via Cadbury Camp fort and reward yourself for those miles with a dip in the lake at the end. To get back either reverse the route or take a public bus back into Bristol town.

            <br>
                <p>Warleigh Weir is located closer to Bath than Bristol but is a very popular spot for any wild swimmer. The disadvantages of this spot are it can get very busy in the summer and there is no official parking. We think the latter is a great opportunity to use alternative transport options if they are available to you. See below for our recommendations. </p>
               
                <p>Once you have arrived at the Weir there is easy access into the water (small steps) and a large area of grass to bask in the sun after your swim. </p>
                 <p>It is private land and needs to be respected. You canâ€™t have BBQs and there are no amenities. Make sure you have everything you need for a fun day of picnics and swimming.  </p>
                 <p>Warleigh Weir is campaigning to be an official Designated Swimming Spot. This means that the water quality would be regularly checked. You can help make this happen, take a look at the information provided <a href="https://warleighweir.co.uk/designated-bathing-water/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

             <p> Eastwood Farm has a large green space for picnics and is also the same side as the wonderful Beeseâ€™s Riverside pub. It can get very busy on this side of the river due to itâ€™s accesibility and space to enjoy.
