                <h2>Mental health</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>There is growing evidence of the benefits of wild swimming for your mental health. The immersion of your body in cold water increases your dopamine levels. Focusing on your breathing while you enter cold water is a mindful experience and makes you feel present. Along with many other mental health benefits. </p>

                <h2>Fitness</h2>
                <hr>
                <p> Swimming can be any level of a workout. From powering out lengths to a more gentle stroke just to get moving a little. It is low impact unlike running and uses lots of muscles.  </p>

                <h2>Post-swim Buzz</h2>
                <hr>
                <p> Technically, this should come under mental health benefits. It is such a joy, it needs it's own section. Every wild swimmer will be able to tell you about their post-swim buzz. It's the reason we all keep coming back! Even if you took some convincing to get in the water, it's pretty much guanteed you will be giddy after your swim. Its such a great way to start the day or wash away the days stress!   </p>

            <h2>Kit List</h2>
            <div id="kit-list-left">
            <ul>
              <li>Swimming costume- our favourite swim suit for women are Batoko . Your swim suit or swim shorts don’t need to be anything fancy, however their are thicker options for those would need the extra layer.</li>  
              <li>Wetsuits - Check out Elise Downing’s (adventurer!) guide to open water wetsuits. </li>  
              <li>Neoprene gloves and boots - A great way to bridge the gap between full wetsuit and full skins swim. Keep your extremities toasty for an easier dip!</li>  
              <li>Towel or Robbie - Towelled changing robes are great for changing in the wild. </li>  
              <li>Dryrobe - These are becoming more and more popular. They are pricey and I wouldn’t buy one until you plan to commit to swimming reguarly. A waterproof coat and extra layers will do a good enough job!</li>
              <li>Swim cap or wooly hat - Depending on your swim style you will need some kind of hat to keep you warm. Top tip: If you are going wooly, bring 2 so you have one for when you get out!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="kit-list-right">
            <ul>
                <li>Tow Float - These tie around your waste and make you more visible in the water. It is very important to use one of these if there is boat traffic or other water users.</li>  
                <li>Layers, layers and more layers - Trust me, you do not want to get caught out with not enough warmth after your swim. Think socks, thermals, down jackets & gloves are all welcomed. </li>  
                <li>Coffee flask - Whatever your prefered hot drinks is (Chai, tea, coffee, hot chocolate), bring it with you to the spot. So you can drink it while you pace along to warm up. </li>  
                <li>Sweet treat- You should always eat before you swim (at least an hour before!). It is a good idea to bring a sweet treat incase your sugar levels drop. </li>  
                <li>Camera - You can get waterproof cases for phones and they can make some cool shots. But please don’t lose the experience of just being in the water.</li>
