                <p>Wild swimming is not the same as getting into to a warm, safe swimming pool. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find safe entry/ exit points.</li>

                <p>Your kit can make your experience a lot more enjoyable and safe. It is important to have plenty of warm clothing for after your swim. </p>

                <hr>
                <p>Anything can happen when you swim in the wild. Especially during the colder periods your body can react unexpectedly to the cold.  </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It is best to swim with someone who knows the area and can advise on entry/exit points. 
                    
                    You should also tell someone where and when you plan to swim.

                <hr>
                    <p>It may be tempting, but do not jump straight in. You can suffer Cold Water Shock and this is very dangerous. </p>
                
                    <p> Instead, you should slowly enter the water and concentrate on your breathing. Give your body time to adjust to the change in temperature. Do not dunk under until you have control of your breathing. </p>

                        <p>
                        Regular swims and cold showers will also help prepare your body for the cold temperatures. </p>

                <h2>5. Warm Up Slowly </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Your body temperature will continue to drop when you are out of the water: this is called Afterdrop. You may feel ok but start drying and changing as soon as you get out. 
                    It is important to have plenty of warm dry, layers to put on straight after your swim.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Hot drinks are a great way to slowly bring your temperature back up.

                <br>
                <p>Swimming in the wild is an extreme sport and it is recommended that you get lessons. If you are a complete beginner to swimming you should have pool lessons first.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>If you are ready to take the next step and start wild swimming then you can get lessons in open water.</p>
