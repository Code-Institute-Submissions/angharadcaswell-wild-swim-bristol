# 1. Project Goals
## 1.1 Reason for website:
1. There are no websites available for swim spots specifically in Bristol, UK. 
2. Swimmers should not be swimming without safety information.
3. There are benefits to swimming in the wild both mentally and physically and this website will hopefully encourage people to try wild swimming. 

## 1.2 Goals:
1. Build a website for people in Bristol to be able to find wild swimming spots. 
2. Provide information on kit and safety. 
3. Connect swimmers in Bristol.
Get people swimming for mental and physical health benefits.

5. As a new swimmer, I want information on the kit I need to go swimming so I can make sure I am prepared. 

6. As a new swimmer, I want to feel confident and excited about swimming when I read this website. 

7. As a user, I want the WILD SWIM BRISTOL to responsive so I can use the site on different devices. 

8. As a user, I want the WILD SWIM BRISTOL to have a clear layout and navigation so I can the find information I need easily. 

## 2.2 Design

WILD SWIM BRISTOL website has a clean, fresh design. It should be eye catching but not distracting from the content. 

### Font
The header font is [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway) and the main font is [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont). Along with their bold versions,both of these fonts have been imported from Google Fonts. 
Raleway has been used to sytle the SWIM WILD BRISTOL logo as well as the headings. Both fonts are attractive, modern and easy to read. 

### Color Scheme 

![Color Scheme](readmeimages/project_color.png)

The colors were generated to be inspiring for people who are interested in getting into wild swimming and spending time in nature. They are mainly blues and greens for this reason.
