## 1.2 Goals:
1. Build a website for people in Bristol to be able to find wild swimming spots. 
2. Provide information on kit and safety. 
3. Connect swimmers in Bristol.
Get people swimming for mental and physical health benefits.

## 2.2 Design

WILD SWIM BRISTOL website has a clean, fresh design. It should be eye catching but not distracting from the content. 

### Font
The header font is [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway) and the main font is [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont). Along with their bold versions,both of these fonts have been imported from Google Fonts. 
Raleway has been used to sytle the SWIM WILD BRISTOL logo as well as the headings. Both fonts are attractive, modern and easy to read. 

### Color Scheme
